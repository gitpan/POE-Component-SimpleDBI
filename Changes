   rows ( not lowercase! ) - MULTIPLE queries return lowercase rows
 - This makes me *VERY* tempted to fix SINGLE to return lowercase, is this
   a good idea? Let me know!

1.15 0000-00-00T00:00:00Z UTC

 - Finally use a Changes file - thanks RT #18981
 - Fixed a bug in SINGLE if returned_rows = 0 it will not return undef, but
   give us blank rows!
 - Documentation tweaks

1.12 0000-00-00T00:00:00Z UTC
 - In the SubProcess, added a binmode() to STDIN and STDERR, for the
   windows attempt
 - Added code to make SimpleDBI work in Win32 boxes, thanks to the recent
   Wheel::Run patches!
 - Documentation tweaks as usual

1.11 0000-00-00T00:00:00Z UTC
 - Hannes had a problem: His IRC bot logs events to a database, and
   sometimes there is no events to log after hours and hours of inactivity
   ( must be a boring channel haha ), the db server disconnected!
 - The solution was to do a $dbh->ping() before each query, if your DBI
   driver does it inefficiently, go yell at them!
 - In the event that a reconnect is not possible, an error will be sent to
   the CONNECT event handler, look at the updated pod.

1.10 0000-00-00T00:00:00Z UTC
 - Fixed a bug in the DO routine, thanks to Hannes!
